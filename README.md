🐐 WOOL STREET: THE MOST STYLISH IOTA GAMEFI

Wool Street is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) GameFi built on the IOTA Testnet. The project focuses on the Play-to-Own (P2O) concept, where users can collect, customize, and manage exclusive digital assets (accessories) for their main NFT character, Billy the Goat.

🌟 KEY FEATURES V1 (MVP)

Asset Ownership (NFT): Goats and Accessories are objects in the IOTA Smart Contract, so asset ownership is 100% guaranteed in the hands of the user.

Real-Time IOTA Economy:

Wallet balances are displayed in real-time from the Testnet (in IOTA units).

Total Asset Value is calculated from the Goat + all owned Accessories.

Complete Outfit Cycle: Provides a full-loop Smart Contract interaction:

Buy: Purchase Accessories from the market contract (including a $1% admin fee).

Equip/Unequip: Equip and remove Accessories from the Goat using the wardrobe contract.

Sell: Sell Accessories back to the market to add to your wallet balance.
